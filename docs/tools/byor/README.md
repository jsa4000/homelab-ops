# Build my Radar

Note: You could previously build your own radar on `radar.thoughtworks.com` using custom quadrant and ring names. Going forward, on the online version of BYOR, you will need to use the 4 quadrant and ring names from the TW Tech Radar, as mentioned below:

* **Quadrant names:** Techniques, Platforms, Tools, Languages & Frameworks
* **Ring names:** Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold

If you set up a local version of BYOR, you can configure custom quadrant and ring names. You can find more details in the readme file.
