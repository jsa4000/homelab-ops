# Sentinel continuously monitors the health of the Redis Master/Replica nodes by executing various health
# check and ping commands. In the event of a failure, Sentinel orchestrates the failover process by promoting
# a replica node to become the new master, ensuring uninterrupted service. This automatic failover capability
# differentiates Redis Sentinel from standard Master-Replica deployments of Redis, where failover must be
# managed manually.
